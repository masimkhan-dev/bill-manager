# Bill Manager Application

This is a Python-based Bill Manager application that allows you to create, store, and manage bills for customers. It supports generating QR codes for each bill, saving them locally in JSON format, and displaying a report of all bills. Additionally, the app provides the functionality to send emails with bill details.

## Features

- **Add Bill**: Enter customer name, bill ID, and items in JSON format (name, price, quantity) to generate a bill.
- **Generate QR Code**: Automatically generates a QR code for the bill details, including customer name, bill ID, and items.
- **Report Generation**: View a report of all saved bills, including customer name, bill ID, total amount, and timestamp.
- **Email Support**: Send bill details via email (requires SMTP configuration).
- **Local Storage**: All bills are stored in a JSON file on the local machine.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `qrcode` library (for generating QR codes)
- `tkinter` (for the GUI)
- `smtplib` (for email functionality)
- `json` (for storing and retrieving bill data)

### Install Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bill-manager.git
cd bill-manager
```

2. **Run the application**:

```bash
python bill_manager.py
```

This will launch a graphical user interface (GUI) where you can:

- Enter a **customer name**, **bill ID**, and **items** in JSON format.
- Generate a **QR code** for the bill.
- View a **report** of all saved bills.

### JSON Format for Items

The "Items (JSON format)" field expects a JSON array of objects, where each object represents an item. Example:

```json
[
  {"name": "Apple", "price": 30, "quantity": 3},
  {"name": "Banana", "price": 10, "quantity": 5}
]
```

### Sending Email

You can configure the email sending functionality by modifying the `send_email()` function with your email credentials. It uses the SMTP protocol to send the bill details via email.
